# Account Setup

You must have a site account created to write for PSLegends. This account must be in your name and **not** a pseudonym.

As a writer for PSLegends, your name will be published on the site under the [Team](https://pslegends.com/team/) page along with being published alongside your articles.

Once you have created your account, you will need to contact a member of the PSLegends staff to gain the relevant permissions to write for the site.
