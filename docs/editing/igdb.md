# IGDB Game Integration

**NOTE**: This section is relevant only to an editor of the site. If you are an article writer, you can safely ignore this section.

# Introduction

We use "Game Profiles" on PSLegends to attach each post (news/reviews) to a relevant Game. These games are searched via [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/) and then automatically added to the site. All the game metadata is pulled from IGDB automatically and stored for each game.

## Adding an IGDB Game

To begin, you can browse to this link: https://pslegends.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=igdb-integration

You can also click "IGDB Integration" on the sidebar and again click "IGBD Integration" from the dropdown.

You can then search for the game you are looking for. You can alternatively filter to a specific platform (PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5 and so on).

Click the "Import" button to import a game. If the game has already been previously imported, you will get a "This game has already been added to the site" message.

## Adding a Review Game Rating to Game

Once a game has been imported, you can edit the game to add the game rating. This is the rating that will be displayed on the game page along with showing the rating on the bottom right of the review on the front of the website. 

Click "Games" on the admin dashboard then "All Games". Find the game in question and hit "Edit". Scroll down to the "Information for the rating block" section and update the "Our Rating" field with the review score. Finally, hit update on the top right to update the post.

Which then looks like this on the front-end of the site:

**REMINDER: Don't forget to attach the game to the post you are writing or the review score will not show on the front of the site.**

## Issue: IGDB Game Not Found

Sometimes if the game is new and relatively unknown, it may not be found on IGDB. In this case, please report it to me and I can add Playstation as a platform for the game on the IGDB website. This takes a couple of hours to be approved and then you can add the game to the site.
