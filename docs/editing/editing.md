# Editor

**NOTE**: This section is relevant only to an editor of the site. If you are an article writer, you can safely ignore this section.

## Editing Article

Edit the article as you normally would following best practices. Yoast SEO guidelines should be followed as closely as possible, but we accept that not all articles will be able to follow all guidelines. This is especially true for list style articles which tend to be more difficult to optimize for Yoast SEO.

## Publishing

Once an article is ready to be published, you must check the publishing checklist to make sure it is ready to go live.

**NOTE ON RELEASE SCHEDULE**: We don't have a set release schedule, however, if we have 5 pending reviews and 5 pending retro reviews. We do not want to publish them all on the same day. We want to spread them out over the course of a week or two. We should never post two main reviews or two retro reviews on the same day unless we have no other choice due to game release schedules.

The optimal release schedule is as follows:

- Publish a non-time sensitive review on a day when no other main review is scheduled.
- Publish a retro review on any day that no other retro review is scheduled.
- Both a main review and a retro review can be published on the same day if there are no other reviews scheduled for that day.

### Publishing Checklist

Not all points on this checklist will be relevant to all articles. For example, a news article will not need the blocks mentioned, nor will it need a game score page to be updated.

- [ ] Check the article for spelling and grammar errors.
- [ ] Check the article for formatting errors.
- [ ] Check the article for SEO errors.
- [ ] Make sure the article title follows a consistent format such as "Game Name Review: Subtitle". We don't inclue game system in the title such as (PS4) or (PS5).
- [ ] Make sure a featured image is set for the article.
- [ ] Make sure the article is set to the correct category. A review needs the **Review** category. A retro review needs the **Retro Review** category **AND** the **Review** category. Likewise a news article needs the **News** category and so on.
- [ ] Make sure the article has an excerpt set. You can take the first paragraph of the article and use that as the excerpt if needed.
- [ ] Make sure the game profile is set for the article. If the game profile does not exist, create it using the IGDB integration page. See the [Game Profile](/writing/editor#game-profile) page for more information.
- [ ] Make sure the following 3 blocks are correctly used on the article; "On this page", "Joys and Cons" and "Rating" blocks. See the [Blocks](/writing/editor#pslegends-specific-blocks) page for more information.
- [ ] Once a review is published, browse to the associated game page for that review (https://pslegends.com/games/far-cry-primal/ for example) and hit edit to edit it. This is similar to editing a post. Browse to the bottom for "Information for the rating block" update "Our Rating" to the review score and save.
