# Superthread

PSLegends has a Superthread account which you can use to organize your upcoming/in-progress articles.

Please make use of this. Access to our Superthread board can be found [here](https://app.superthread.com/pslegends/space-2/boards).

**Please do not share this link with anyone.**

## How to use Superthread

Superthread is a simple Kanban board. It's a great way to organize your articles and keep track of what you're working on.

## Adding a new article that you want to write

First, visit the relevant space you want to work in. Spaces are divided up like so:

- Reviews
- Retro Reviews
- News
- Guides

Then once you are in a space, create a new card in any of the `Backlog`, `To do`, `Doing`, `Done` or `Cancelled` columns and add a title to it and assign yourself. You can also add a description to the card if you want to add more details.

## Take on an article

If you see an item that is not assigned to anyone that you want to write, simply drag it to the `Doing` column and assign yourself to it.

## Submitting an article

Once you've finished writing an article, simply drag it to the `Done` column. This will let us know that you've finished writing it, and we can start the review process.
