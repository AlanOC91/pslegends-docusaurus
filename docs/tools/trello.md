## How to use Trello

Trello is a simple Kanban board. It's a great way to organize your articles and keep track of what you're working on.

## Adding a new article that you want to write

Simply create a new card in any of the `TODO` columns and add a title to it and assign yourself. You can also add a description to the card if you want to add more details.

## Take on an article

If you see an article that you want to write, simply drag it to the `In Progress` column and assign yourself to it.

## Submitting an article

Once you've finished writing an article, simply drag it to the `Ready for Publish` column. This will let us know that you've finished writing it, and we can start the review process.

## Finalizing an article (article editor only)

Once the article has been published, the article editor will move it to the `Published` column.
