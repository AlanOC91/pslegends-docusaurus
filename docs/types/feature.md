# Features

Features are a core type of article that can be popular over a long period of time. They are usually longer than a news article and are often more in-depth.

## Feature Examples

1. [Top 5 Best Selling PS2 Games](https://pslegends.com/top-5-best-selling-ps2-games/)
2. [Dual-Questing: PS1 JRPGs Perfect for Podcasting](https://pslegends.com/dual-questing-ps1-jrpgs-perfect-for-podcasting/)
3. [The 10 Rarest PS3 Games and Their Possibility of Being Ported to the PS5](https://pslegends.com/the-10-rarest-ps3-games-and-their-possibility-of-being-ported-to-the-ps5/)

We are basically looking for featurettes, top 10 lists (listicles), historic pieces and other articles that are more in-depth than a news article.
