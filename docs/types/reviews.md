# Reviews

Reviews are the bread and butter of PSLegends. We will try aim to review upcoming and populars games and attempt to have the review live before the game is released.

## Minimum Word Count 

The minimum word count for a review is around **1700 - 2000 words** plus. This is to ensure that the review is detailed enough to give the reader a good idea of what the game is like. This minimum count can slightly vary depending on the nature of the game. A block buster AAA game will require more words than a smaller indie game.

## Minimum Gameplay Time

The minimum gameplay time for a review is around **5-10 hours**. This is to ensure that the reviewer has a good idea of what the game is like and can give a fair review. This minimum time can slightly vary depending on the nature of the game. A block buster AAA game will require more time to learn and showcase all of the systems rather than a smaller indie game.

People have lives, we don't require our reviews to be 100% complete. We just want to ensure that the reviewer has a good idea of what the game is like and can give a fair review.
