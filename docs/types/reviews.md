# Reviews

Reviews are the bread and butter of PSLegends. We will try aim to review upcoming and populars games and attempt to have the review live before the game is released.

## Minimum Word Count 

The minimum word count for a review is around **1700 - 2000 words** plus. This is to ensure that the review is detailed enough to give the reader a good idea of what the game is like. This minimum count can slightly vary depending on the nature of the game. A block buster AAA game will require more words than a smaller indie game.

## Minimum Gameplay Time

The minimum gameplay time for a review is around **5-10 hours**. This is to ensure that the reviewer has a good idea of what the game is like and can give a fair review. This minimum time can slightly vary depending on the nature of the game. A block buster AAA game will require more time to learn and showcase all of the systems rather than a smaller indie game.

People have lives, we don't require our reviews to be 100% complete. We just want to ensure that the reviewer has a good idea of what the game is like and can give a fair review.

## Old Games?

See the [Classic Reviews](/types/reviews-classic) section.

## What about mini/indie/short games?

We understand that not all games are made equal. As such we have come to the concession that some games will not require the same amount of time and words as others. For example, small indie games that can be beat in 3-4 hours should not require the same length of review as a 100 hour RPG.

With that said, you can review small/short indie games at the same rate as a regular review but you will need to ensure that the review is detailed enough to give the reader a good idea of what the game is like.

**We are also monitoring the situation to ensure our writers don't exclusively review short games as we want to ensure we have a diverse range of reviews.**
