# Evergreen Content

Evergreen content is content that is always relevant. It is content that does not go out of date. It is content that is always useful to the reader.

## Difference between Evergreen Content and our Guides

Evergreen content is different from our guides. Evergreen content is usually shorter and more focused than our guides. It is also usually more general and less specific than our guides. For example, a guide may showcase the full entire game while an Evergreen Content may only showcase a specific feature of the game. A common example would be something like "List of all the weapons in the game" or "List of all the characters in the game".
