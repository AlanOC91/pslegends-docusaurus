# Guides

Guides are designed to be in depth articles that cover a specific topic. They are usually based on a single topic and are not time sensitive. For example, a guide could be about how to complete a specific task in a game or how to use a specific feature in a game.

## Full Game Guide or Single Topic Guide?

There are two types of guides that can be written. A full game guide or a single topic guide. 

### Full Game Guide

A full game guide is a guide that covers the entire game. For example, a full game guide could be about how to complete a game from start to finish. These guides are usually very long and in depth. They are designed to be the go to guide for a game.

### Single Topic Guide

A single topic guide is a guide that covers a specific topic in a game. For example, a single topic guide could be about how to complete a specific task in a game or how to use a specific feature in a game. These guides are usually shorter and more focused than a full game guide. They are designed to be a quick read that can be consumed in a few minutes.

## Minimum Word Count

The minimum word count for a **Full Game** guide is around **2000 - 3000 words** plus. This is to ensure that the guide is detailed enough to give the reader a good idea of what the guide is about. This minimum count can slightly vary depending on the nature of the guide. A guide about a complex topic will require more words than a guide about a simple topic.

There is no minimum word count for a **Single Topic** guide. However, please ensure that the guide is detailed enough to give the reader a good idea of what the guide is about.

## Payment Note

**Full Game Guides** are paid at the same rate as regular reviews. I understand that guides take much, much longer to complete, but we are currently not in a position to pay more for guides. This may change in the future.

**Single Topic Guides** are paid at a much lower rate than reviews. This is due to the nature of the content. Single Topic Guides are usually short and sweet and can be completed in a few minutes to hours.

See the [Payment](/category/payment) section for more information.
