# Reviews Classic

Classic reviews are based on older games as far back as the original Sony Playstation. These reviews are not time sensitive and can be completed at the reviewers leisure.

## What is an old/classic game?

An old/classic game is any game that is two or more generations old. For example, at the time of writing the Sony Playstation 5 is the latest generation of console. Therefore, any game that was released on the Sony Playstation 3 or earlier is considered an old/classic game.

## What about ports of old games?

A port of an old game would fall under a regular review. For example, if a game was originally released on the Sony Playstation 2 and then ported to the Sony Playstation 4, it would be considered a regular review as the game is technically still a current generation game.

## What about PS Classics on PSN?

A PS Classic on PSN would fall under a classic review. Since these are emulated experiences, we would consider them to be old/classic games simply wrapped in a modern wrapper.

## Minimum Word Count

The minimum word count for a classic review is around **1400 - 2000 words** plus. This is to ensure that the review is detailed enough to give the reader a good idea of what the game is like. This minimum count can slightly vary depending on the nature of the game. A block buster AAA game will require more words than a smaller indie game.

## Minimum Gameplay Time

The minimum gameplay time for a classic review is around **5-10 hours**. This is to ensure that the reviewer has a good idea of what the game is like and can give a fair review. However, since these are older games that are usually well documented, we appreciate going into more detail on the vast majority of gameplay systems available in the game. For example, should the reviewer decide to review **Final Fantasy VII**, we would be expecting a longer review than a game like **Crash Bandicoot**.

People have lives, we don't require our reviews to be 100% complete. We just want to ensure that the reviewer has a good idea of what the game is like and can give a fair review.
