# Previews

A preview is used before a game is released. It is used to showcase the game to the reader and give them a good idea of what the game is like and what to expect for the upcoming release. It is usually based on a single topic and is not time sensitive.

A **preview** must never be published after the game is released. If the game is released, the preview must be converted to a review.

## Minimum Word Count

The minimum word count for a preview is around **1000 - 1500 words** plus. This is to ensure that the preview is detailed enough to give the reader a good idea of what the game is like and what to expect from the upcoming release. This minimum count can slightly vary depending on the nature of the game. 

## Retro?

We will not be doing retro previews, this wouldn't make sense. If a game is already released, it should be reviewed. See the [Reviews](/types/reviews) section for more information.
