# News

News pieces are usually short and sweet. They are designed to be quick reads that can be consumed in a few minutes. They are usually based on a single topic and are not time sensitive. For example, a news piece could be about a new game announcement or a new feature being added to a game.

## Minimum Word Count

There is no minimum word count for a news piece. However, please ensure that the news piece is detailed enough to give the reader a good idea of what the news piece is about.

## Payment Note

News pieces are paid at a much lower rate than reviews. This is due to the nature of the content. News pieces are usually short and sweet and can be completed in a few minutes to hours. Whereas reviews are much more in depth and can take days to complete.

See the [Payment](/category/payment) section for more information.
