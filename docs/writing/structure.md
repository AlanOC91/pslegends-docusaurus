# Review Structure

**Note:** This is not a must-follow structure, but it may be useful for those who are new to writing reviews.

**Title**: Give a good descriptive title for the game you are reviewing and make sure to include the word "Review" in the title. For example, "Final Fantasy 16 Review - A Triumphant Return to Form".

**Structure**: The structure of the review should be as follows:

- **Opening Blurb**: A brief introduction to the review. This can include a brief description of the game, the developer, the publisher, and the platforms the game is available on. You can also talk about your history with the franchise and your opens/expectations here.


- **Introduction**: A brief introduction to the game and its world. Set the scene for the reader. In my Final Fantasy XVI review, I spoke about the world of Valisthea, the Eikons and the Mothercrystals. I also spoke about the main characters and their roles in the story without spoiling anything or going into too much detail.


- **Story**: A brief overview of the story. This can include the main story, the side stories, the characters, the plot twists, and the ending (if you want to go into that much detail). You can also talk about the game's pacing and if it feels too slow or too fast. This section or Gameplay are usually the longest sections of the review.


- **Gameplay**: A brief overview of the gameplay. This can include the combat, the exploration, the progression, the customization, and the side activities. You can also talk about the game's difficulty and how it compares to other games in the genre. 


- **Graphics/Sound**: A brief overview of the graphics and sound. This can include the visuals, the art style, the animations, the voice acting, the music, and the sound effects. You can also talk about the game's performance and if there are frame drops or other issues.


- **Replayability**: A brief overview of the replayability. This can include the game's length, the game's difficulty, the game's side activities, the game's collectibles, and the game's replay value. You can also talk about the game's replay value and if it is worth playing again. Maybe the game has a new game plus mode or multiple endings.


- **Conclusion**: A brief conclusion to the review. This can include your final thoughts on the game, your final score, and your final recommendation. You can also talk about the game's price and if it is worth buying at full price or if it is better to wait for a sale.
