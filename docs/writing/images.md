# Images

Images can and should often be used in articles to help break up the text and to make the article more visually appealing. Images can be added to articles in a number of ways.

## Adding Images to Articles via the Image Block

The easiest way to add images to articles is to use the Image Block. This block allows you to upload an image from your computer or to select an image from the media library. Once the image is uploaded, you can then add a caption to the image. The caption will be displayed below the image when the article is published. 

**NOTE: Please try center align your image captions. This will make the article look more consistent.**

## Adding Images to Articles via the Slider Block

The Slider Block allows you to add an image gallery with slider functionality to your article. This is useful for adding screenshots to your article. I believe this is most beneficial at the end of the article (before review scores if a review).

## Featured Image

The featured image is the image that will be displayed on the article page and across the site. This is just as important as setting a category. It is recommended that you use an image that is relevant to the article you are writing. If you don't set a featured image, one will be set for you before the article is published.

# Image Optimisation

Images should be optimised before being uploaded to the site. This will help to reduce the size of the image and will help to improve the performance of the site. We lazy load images on the front-end of the site for performance but they should always be kept to a minimal filesize for those on slower connections.

Optimal filesizes for images would be roughly **100kb - 400kb**. This will vary depending on the image. For example, a 4K screenshot of a game will be a large filesize. However, a screenshot of a game from the PS1 era will be a much smaller filesize.

You can optimize your image filesizes using a site such as [this](https://tinyjpg.com/). This will compress and remove metadata from your images. This will help to reduce the filesize of the image.

We recommend you save images as **.jpg** files. This will help to reduce the filesize of the image. Most computer programs these days can change the format of an image, the most common being from .png to .jpg. If you are unsure how to do this, you can use a free online tool such as [this one](https://convertio.co/png-jpg/).
