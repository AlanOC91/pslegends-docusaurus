# Article Links

## Important note on linking

Don't overdo it. Links are great, but too many links can be distracting and can make your article look messy. Only link to things that are relevant to the article you are writing. Usually you would link for the first mention of something. For example, if you are writing a news article about a game, you would link to the game profile on the first mention of the game. You would not link to the game profile on every mention of the game.

## Linking to Other Articles

When writing an article, you may want to link to another article on the site. The aim of this is to allow users to easily navigate to other articles that may be related to the one they are currently reading. So if you are writing a news article that mentions a game, you may want to link to the review of that game or the game page itself.

## Linking to Tags

When writing an article, you may want to link to a tag on the site. Tags are user defined but can often be useful to retain retention and to allow easier navigation. For example, if I am writing a news article about "Mortal Kombat", I tend to always use a "Mortal Kombat" tag on these articles. You can then use this tag (/tag/mortal-kombat) in articles that mention Mortal Kombat.
