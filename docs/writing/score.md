# Review Score Policy

At PSLegends, we employ a comprehensive 1 to 10 review scoring system. Each score represents a distinct level of quality, without the use of decimals. Here's how we define each rating:

**1 - Broken**
- Absolutely unplayable. We strongly discourage trying this game.

**2 - Very Bad**
- Barely any redeeming qualities. We do **NOT** recommend.

**3 - Bad**
- Lacks in execution with only a handful of positives.

**4 - Below Average**
- Some potential evident, but falls short in execution.

**5 - Mediocre**
- Sits right in the middle. May appeal to fans of the genre.

**6 - Above Average**
- Shows promise and offers fun, primarily for genre enthusiasts.

**7 - Good**
- A solid pick for genre fans. Could even attract newcomers.

**8 - Very Good**
- Stands out in many areas. A notable recommendation for most.

**9 - Excellent**
- Almost flawless. A definitive play for fans and likely award contender.

**10 - Masterpiece**
- Sets the gold standard. A must-experience for all. **Very rarely awarded.**
