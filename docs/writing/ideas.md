# Topic Ideas

**NOTE**: These are based from our internal analytics and should only be used as a general guide and not an absolute rule.

Refer to this section if you are struggling to come up with a topic to write about. These are some of our past articles that have tended to "trend":

- ["How long to beat"](https://pslegends.com/stellar-blade-confirms-playtime-estimates-for-story-and-100-completion) for a new/recently released game
- Guides! 
  - Our [Digimon World Recruitment Guide](https://pslegends.com/digimon-world-recruitment-guide/) for a 20+ year old game continues to trend every month.
  - Our guide on [how to defeat rare shadows in Persona 3](https://pslegends.com/persona-3-reload-guide-how-to-defeat-all-rare-shadows/) has also done well indicating guides on brand-new games that are already extensively covered elsewhere can still do well. 
- Listicles. As much as they can be annoying, listicles always do well on these type of sites. 
  - I wrote ["Top 5 CRPGS on PlayStation"](https://pslegends.com/quench-your-baldurs-gate-3-cravings-top-5-crpgs-on-playstation/) off the back of Baldur's Gate 3. I think the timing of it worked well.It also trends every month. Not by a large amount but above average. 
- Smaller/Indie Titles.
  - Some of our reviews for smaller games have gone above and beyond in terms of performance. Usually in a very unexpected manner.
  - Our [Dinobreak Review](https://pslegends.com/dinobreak-review-not-quite-dino-crisis/) is one of the top reviews for the game itself and is always pulling in views every month. 
  - Our [Bulwark Review](https://pslegends.com/bulwark-falconeer-chronicles-review-experiencing-chaotic-zen/) did really well and got attention from the main developer himself. This caused a chain reaction which caused a massive spike in views for the site.  
- Remaster/Remake Requests.
  - Our [The Case for Remastering Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories](https://pslegends.com/time-for-a-comeback-the-case-for-remastering-yu-gi-oh-forbidden-memories/) has done since it's inception and continually pulls in views every month. I am personally fond of these articles as they allow people to use their imagination for what may come with the aid of viewing the current game through the article itself.
