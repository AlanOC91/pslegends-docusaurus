# Start

The PSLegends site is based on the WordPress CMS. As such, writing for PSLegends will make use of the WordPress Content Editor. 

The WordPress content editor will allow you to write your articles in a similar fashion to a word processor, save them for later, and publish them for review when you are ready.

Once an article is submitted for review, it is then reviewed by a member of the PSLegends staff. Once approved, the article will be published to the site.
