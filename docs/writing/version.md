# Listing Game Version

This is a requirement from Metacritic. When a game is **reviewed** we must list the version of the game that was reviewed. This means we need a short paragraph such as "Played on PS5" or "PS4 version Played on PS4 Pro" and so on.

## How to add a version

For the moment, a simple paragraph at the end of the review will suffice.

`PS5 game version`

`PS4 game version`

`PS4 game version played on PS4 Pro`

`PS4 game version played on PS5`

`PSN PS1 emulator version played on PS5`
