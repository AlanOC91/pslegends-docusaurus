# NG4

We hope to share all PSLegends articles to [N4G.com](https://n4g.com/) automatically. 

## Can I share my own articles to NG4?

You can, however this may be redundant as we hope to share all articles to N4G automatically.

## Sharing to N4G

If you think you have a news piece that is particularly important and few have covered it, you can (and probably should) share it to N4G.

Create an N4G Account here: https://n4g.com/account/join

Once you have an account, you can submit your article here: https://n4g.com/submit/story?url=

You can also click the "N4G" icon under the article banner image to share the article to N4G more easily.

## N4G Guidelines

N4G are extremely particular about how you format the item you are submitting. Please follow these guidelines:

- Reviews: "Game Title Review [PSLegends]"
  - Example: God of War Review [PSLegends]
  - PSLegends must appear at the end of reviews surrounded by square brackets.
  - They do **not** allow exclamation marks at the end of the title.
  - If submitting a review, it must be a game recently released (6 months I think is the timeframe).
  - Set type to **Review**.
  - Set the score out of 10.
  - Correctly tag the game and the exact version (the PS version in our case).
  - In the description box, make sure the summary is complete (I usually copy the opening paragraph of the review) but if the content contains passive language (like "I found" or "I think") then you need to start the summary with "Authorname said:" (replace Authorname with the actual Author Name) and then the summary.
- Retro Reviews: "Game Title Retro Review"
  - Example: Final Fantasy VII Retro Review
  - Do not add the review site to the title.
  - Set type to **Opinion Piece**.
  - Follow the same description box rules as Reviews.
  - Correctly tag the game and the exact version (the PS version in our case).
- News/Features: "Title"
  - Example: New PS5 Update
  - PSLegends must appear at the end of the title surrounded by square brackets.
  - Set type to **News** for news pieces and **Opinion Piece** for features.
  - Correctly tag the game and the exact version (the PS version in our case).
  - Generally just the opening paragraph of the article is enough for the description box. We normally don't have "I found" or "I think" in our news pieces so you can just copy the opening paragraph.
