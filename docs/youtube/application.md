# PSLegends YouTube

**NOTE**: This is currently only in-theory. We have not yet started a YouTube channel.

PSLegends may have a YouTube channel where we post video content. This includes reviews, guides, and news.

The idea is to transcribe the article into a video format. This means that the video will be a voice-over of the article (you can paraphrase) with some gameplay footage in the background.

The original article will be linked in the description of the video and the article author will be credited in the video at the beginning.

**Please let us know if you're interested in doing this, so we can gauge interest.**
