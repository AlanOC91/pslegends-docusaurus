# Structure

At these early stages, if you wish to do a video for PSLegends, you are currently expected to capture footage, do the voice-over, and edit the video yourself.

We will provide you with a template for the video, which will include the intro and outro.

Most videos will be transcribed of articles that we have on PSLegends, so you will be expected to read the article and paraphrase it in your own words.
