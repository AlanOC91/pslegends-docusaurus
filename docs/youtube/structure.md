# Structure

Our videos for PSLegends should all follow a similar standardized structure. This is to ensure that all videos are consistent and of high quality.

## Intro

We will roll a standarized PSLegends intro for all videos.

## Intro Narration Title

Welcome to the "PSLegends Reivew/Preview/Feature" of "Game Title". This piece was originally written by "Author Name" and published on "Date" on the PSLegends website.

## Narration

You will be expected to read the article, and you are allowed to paraphrase it in your own words where you feel necessary. You can also add your own thoughts and opinions to the video and make reference to how the original article made you feel and your opinions on the subject matter. These are optional but at a minimum you must follow the original article structure and content. 

For example, don't change the review score or the main points of the article for your own opinion.

## Video Footage

Video Footage can be captured from the game itself, or from other sources such as trailers or gameplay videos. You are allowed to take footage from Longplay videos online to use in your video. You **MUST** provide constant credit to the original source of the footage in the video itself (and additionally in the video description).

For example, if you took Longplay footage for a game from "User X" then you will need to overlay the footage with a watermark that says "Footage from User X" and also include a line in the video description that says "Footage from User X" with a link to the original video.

## Pros/Cons and Review Score

You will be expected to read the Pros/Cons and Review Score from the original article. You can add your own thoughts and opinions to this section as well after you have read the original content.

## Outro

We will roll a standarized PSLegends outro for all videos.

## Video Thumbnail

You can re-utilize our fancy new article thumbnails for your video. For example, if you picked Pennyâ€™s Big Breakaway then you can use the image associated with that article.

## Video Description

The first link should 100% always be the link to the PSLegends article.

After that, we add any source references we have used in the video.

Finally, we have the standarized YouTube description that is auto-set on all videos.
