# Thumbnails

Ideally, for Thumbnails, we want to use a consistent style across all videos. This will help viewers recognize our content and brand. If possible, please take the image from the [PSLegends](https://pslegends.com) website.

For example, if you wanted to do a video on our **Dragon's Dogma 2** review then you could pull the image from the review: https://pslegends.com/dragons-dogma-2-review-death-by-1000-gripes/

Right click image -> Open image in new tab -> Save image as -> Upload to YouTube.

**NOTE**: Remove the size from the URL to get the full image.

So this:
https://pslegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dragon-dogma-2-review-pslegends-1024x576.jpg

Becomes:
https://pslegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dragon-dogma-2-review-pslegends.jpg

## Custom Thumbnails

On the off-chance that we need to utilize custom thumbnails (for example, for a video that doesn't have a corresponding article on the website), please request one from **Ryuji** on the Discord server. Please give him exact details on what you want in the thumbnail and offer him any **.png** files you have that you want to be included in the thumbnail.
