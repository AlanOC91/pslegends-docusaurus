# Reposting Articles

## What is Reposting?

Reposting is the act of taking an article that has already been written by you elsewhere and posting it again on PSLegends.

Any articles you write for PSLegends must be original content. You cannot repost articles you have written elsewhere.

## What happens if you Repost?

If you repost you will be immediately removed from the staff team. You will also be removed from the Discord server. No payments will be made for a reposted article.

## What about my PSLegends articles?

You cannot repost your PSLegends articles elsewhere. By posting an article on PSLegends you are giving PSLegends the rights to that article (but it must be explicitly credited to you).
